This provides a [build hook](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/config/build/#build-hooks) plugin for [Hatch](https://github.com/pypa/hatch) that compiles code with [Mypyc](https://github.com/mypyc/mypyc).

## Configuration

The [build hook plugin](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/plugins/build-hook/) name is `mypyc`.

- ***pyproject.toml***

    ```toml
    [tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel.hooks.mypyc]
    dependencies = ["hatch-mypyc"]
    ```

- ***hatch.toml***

    ```toml
    [build.targets.wheel.hooks.mypyc]
    dependencies = ["hatch-mypyc"]
    ```

### File selection

By default, the [standard file selection options](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/config/build/#file-selection) will be used. You can override this behavior with the `include`/`exclude` options.

```toml
[build.targets.wheel.hooks.mypyc]
include = ["/pkg"]
exclude = ["__main__.py"]
```

At least one inclusion pattern must be provided overall.

### Mypy arguments

You can specify extra [Mypy arguments](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/command_line.html) with the `mypy-args` option.

```toml
[build.targets.wheel.hooks.mypyc]
mypy-args = [
  "--disallow-untyped-defs",
]
```

### Options

You can specify `options` that affect the behavior of [mypycify](https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/v0.930/mypyc/build.py#L429).

```toml
[build.targets.wheel.hooks.mypyc.options]
opt_level = "3"
```

Note:

- the `target_dir` option is used internally and therefore has no effect

## Missing types

If you need more packages at build time in order to successfully type check, you can use the following options where you [configured the plugin](#configuration):

- `dependencies` - add more dependencies alongside `hatch-mypyc`
- `require-runtime-dependencies` - set to `true` to include dependencies defined in the `project.dependencies` array
